 * @description:
 * Any ‘linearGradient’ attributes which are defined on the referenced
 * element which are not defined on this element are inherited by this element.
 * If this element has no defined gradient stops, and the referenced element does
 * (possibly due to its own ‘xlink:href’ attribute), then this element inherits
 * the gradient stop from the referenced element. Inheritance can be indirect
 * to an arbitrary level; thus, if the referenced element inherits attribute
 * or gradient stops due to its own ‘xlink:href’ attribute, then the current
 * element can inherit those attributes or gradient stops.
