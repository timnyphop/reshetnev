> **Polymorpheus** is a tiny library for polymorphic templates in Angular.
>
> It is 1 KB gzip, dependency free and allows you to make pretty cool things.

## What does it do?

It abstracts over different ways of view customization in Angular with one simple _structural directive_:

```html
<ng-container *polymorpheusOutlet="content as text; context: context">{{text}}</ng-container>
```

**Content** accepts:

- primitives like `number` or `string`
- functions that take `context` as argument and return a primitive
- templates that get instantiated with given `context`
- components that would get `context` injected through DI

**Context** is optional when you need your **content** to adapt to the situation

## How to use it?

Typical use case would be a component that accepts visual customization and defines context by itself. Say a menu list
where you can configure how each item should look like by passing a template. And context would be item itself and, for
example, whether it is focused or not.
